        {PI: Dr Sahana MB}{
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Studied the relative stability of three structural phases of Li1:15(Mn:54Ni:23Co:08)O2,a novel cathode material for Li-ion batteries.
		\item Created complex heterostructures and studied
		their electronic structure using Density Functional Theory.
    \end{itemize}
