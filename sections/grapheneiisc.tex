    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investigating the magnetic properties of functionalized monolayer and intercalated bilayer graphene using Density Functional Theory.
        \item Studied a range of candidates for intercalation and performed stability analysis for those which exhibited a non-trivial magnetic moment.
